#### Liability for Content

The content of our pages has been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and currentness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 (1) TMG (Telemedia Act). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of any such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

#### Copyright

The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any form of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are permitted only for private, non-commercial use.

As far as the content on this site is not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. If you become aware of any copyright infringement, we ask you to notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of any legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.

#### Liability for Links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over which we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any responsibility for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the linked sites is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.

However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon becoming aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
